        <div class="pg"> LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</div>
        <p></p>
        <div class="pg">According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</div>
        <p></p>
        <div class="pg" >CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </div>
        <p></p>
        <ul>* the Cold War</ul>
        <ul>* the civil-rights movement </ul>
